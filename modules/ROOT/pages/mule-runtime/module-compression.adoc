== 2.0.0

*September 2018* 

=== New Features and Enhancements

To provide a better experience using this module, this module adds a new API 
to support archiver compression formats with a new set of operations. This 
provides the same experience to compress and decompress files for each of the 
available formats without losing any of the features that the algorithm for 
the format provides. 

This change enables the possibility of adding more compression formats in a simple manner.

This version now supports the more widely used ZIP compression format, and continues
support for the GZIP format.
